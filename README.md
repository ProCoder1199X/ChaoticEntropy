# ChaoticEntropy

**ChaoticEntropy (DEG v1)** is a hybrid entropy generator designed by Dheeraj Kumar (tech enthusiast).  

It combines human randomness, environmental noise (like temperature), and complex math to create unpredictable numbers and coordinates.

## Features:
- Manual or sensor-based entropy sources
- Complex algorithmic randomness
- Generates random coordinates and values
- Can evolve into quantum-resistant randomness base
- Pattern NOT tracable even with  Quantum Computers or Very powerful (classical) supercomputers.
- Technically Pseduo-Random but practically, truly random. 

## Usage:
Run with Python:
```bash
python degv1.py
