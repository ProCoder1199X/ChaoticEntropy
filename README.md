# 🔥 ChaoticEntropy - Hybrid Entropy Generator 

 **ChaoticEntropy** is an pseudo-randomness that blends **human unpredictability**, **non-linear math**, and **real-world data inputs** to create **nearly quantum-level entropy** — without any quantum computers or radioactive atoms!

## 🚀 About the Project

> Created by Dheeraj Kumar  ( Programmer , Creator of EasiScript , Independent Researcher), ChaoticEntropy is a collection of entropy generation tools meant for use in secure randomness generation, experimentation, and future-forward cybersecurity research.

## 📦 Versions

### ✅ Python Version: `degv1.py`
- Takes user-entered **temperature**
- Takes a **random number** (1–99) from human input
- Generates **random latitude & longitude**
- Performs math-based entropy mixing
- Produces a random number

### 🛠 C Version: `deg-c_v1.c`
- Fully offline, terminal-based entropy generator
- Uses:
  - Manual temperature input
  - Manual human-random input
- Applies **non-linear transformations** (sine, square roots, etc.)
- Generates and prints:
  - Random coordinates
  - Final entropic number (within 0–99999)

#### 🔧 How to Compile & Run:
```bash
gcc degc_v1.c -o degc
./degc
```

## 🔐 Why This Matters

Unlike traditional pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), ChaoticEntropy includes:

- 🎯 **Human unpredictability**
- 🌡️ Optional real-world sensor data
- 🌐 Possibility of internet-based data fusion (e.g., temperature, population)
- 🧠 Mental randomness (your thoughts)
- 🧮 Heavy non-linear math

These features make reverse-engineering or brute-forcing the seed extremely difficult — even for **quantum computers**.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

- Cryptographic entropy injection
- Highly randomized token generation
- Offline secure key creation
- Blockchain randomness oracle (future)
- Educational randomness demonstrator

---

## 🧠 Vision for Future

- Plug in real-time temperature APIs
- Fetch population data based on coordinates
- Add GPIO sensor support
- Mix inputs from multiple humans
- Web version, GUI, and real-world RNG devices
